- 👋 Hi, I’m **@VMVDEUS**
---
- 👀 I’m interested in **music**, **culture**, **languages**, **blockchain** & **freedom**. I speak french, german, spanish and english.
---
- 🌱 I’m currently studying multilingual communication technologies.
---
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Blockchain projects joining my languages, my 12 years experience in finance and my recently acquired skills in communication technologies. In this repository you'll find a quick presentation on how I began making a term base and a translation memory for the Blockchain area using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools.
